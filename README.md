# Asian Online Workshop of Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics

We are a community of linguists based in Asia, meeting (almost) weekly to present and discuss research on the syntax, semantics, and/or pragmatics of Asian languages. Anyone with an interest in SSP or Asian languages is welcomed.  

Meeting dates are scheduled at the begining of each semester. For Fall 2024, we are meeting on Friday evenings or Saturday mornings. Each week's speaker is responsible for arranging an online meeting room for their session.

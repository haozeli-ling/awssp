# Asian Online Workshop on Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics

We are a community of linguists based in Asia, meeting (almost) weekly to present and discuss research on the syntax, semantics, and/or pragmatics of Asian languages. Most of our regular attendees are affiliated with institutions across Asia. A list of these institutions can be found at [the bottom of the page](#institutions-and-their-acronyms), offering insight into the distribution of linguists in the region. This workshop also aims to foster the growth of the linguistics community in Asia and strengthen its connections with the global linguistics community. Anyone with an interest in SSP or Asian languages is welcomed.  

The online workshop is a continued effort of International Conference on the Frontiers of Formal Linguistics held at Huazhong Agricultural University in 2024. Meeting dates are scheduled at the begining of each semester. For Fall 2024, we are meeting on Friday evenings or Saturday mornings. Each week's speaker is responsible for arranging an online meeting room for their session. Please note that all times are in UTC+8.  

If you are interested in sharing your research with us or attending the online sessions, please feel free to reach out to any of the organizers listed below.

**Speaker**: HE Rong (Tsinghua University) & [LIU Mingming](https://markliu02.github.io/) (Tsinghua University) <br>
**Topic**: HAISHI and alternative questions in Mandarin <br>
**Abstract**: It is widely assumed that Mandarin has two disjunctors huozhe and haishi, the latter used exclusively in questions. We challenge the standard view by proposing that haishi is not an interrogative disjunctor but the same adverb used in sentences like 我们还是去颐和园吧 'Let's go to the Summer Palace instead'. Specifically, we argue that both the hai and shi are semantically active, the former contributing additivity while the latter exhaustivity. As a result, when used in a juxtaposition of two sentences, haishi gives rise to a mutual exclusivity presupposition, and requires the juxtaposition be interpreted as a set, which is just the denotation of an alternative question.
